Goal: Predict accessibility issue severity using location and neighborhood characteristics.
Approach: We combined and processed two datasets spanning economic, educational, and infrastructure factors across Seattle neighborhoods, then applied predictive models to identify patterns.
Results: Income, education levels, population age, and infrastructure quality emerged as the primary predictors of accessibility and walkability issues. Areas with lower income, aging populations, and deteriorating infrastructure face significantly higher accessibility risks.
